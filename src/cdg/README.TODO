done: 1.   Apply FUZZYEQ to bdy location in ggrid_icos.cpp. 
2.   Handle Neumann bdy conditions: can same setup (use of ub) be used?
3.   Merge GComm with tbox
done: 4.   Build more generic driver/main program for all time-dep PDE sets
5.   Add constraint of field to sphere in embedded grid type case
6.   Make sure face indices, bdy types are being handled properly in GGridIcos for 3D elems
7.   Make sure that all element-local data that has been globalized is cleared
8.   Verify computation of amount of tmp space required by solver
9.   Complete flux operator, and validate faceNormal vector computations for DG
done:10.  Test I X I X D, I X D X I, etc operators; use only compute_refderivs, not
          compute_refderivsW in GAdvect to reduce no. flops required. NB: testing 
          done, but integration not done.
done: 11.  Add restart capability.
done: 12.  Add forcing.
done: 13.  Generalize the application of initial conditions.
14.  Cube-sphere grid.
15.  Remove iOpR2LIndices and associated quaitites from GGFX
16.  Should we handle boundary updates in the same way as forcing, not via a callback, but in call to constructor (e.g., like the 'mixer' object in Integrator)?
done in master:17. Command line args in main driver: push off to a method; set traits var once we decide what we can change via command line
18. Templatize functions in gmtk.cpp. Generally, these aren't templated bec. the use GGrid object methods that themselves aren't templated.
19. IMPORTANT: (a) code the do_face_normals virtual methods in GGridBox and GGridIcos. These find normals at all element face nodes, and are used to compute integral of fluxes at element faces used for conservative methods; (b) code the do_bdy_normals in GGridBox and GGridIcos classes. These compute the normals at canonical domain boundaries, and are required to specify, e.g., Neuman boundary conditions at those surfaces.
20. Abstract the io: create new class for gio; add factory for different types. Move gioposix to general observer that uses new factory to decide which IO scheme to use.
21. There is a bug in GGFX if GNODEID is size_t
22. I/O restarts and re-decomposition + MPI I/O
32.convective PDE
33. mat-mat when computing derivatives--assuming that p doesn't change between elements
34. test flux formalism
done.35. terrain-following coordinates
36. We no longer require the boundary state in equation_base, et seq. Remove it?
37. Style: make template typepacks consistent; change Value to Ftype everywhere
38. GTVector: the 'contains' & related methods don't use stride, but should. Also, we need to modify gindex so that it doesn't contain unnecessary fields
39. Maybe for a student intern: replace macros SET/GET_HIWORD, SET/GET_LOWORD etc, 
    and SET/GET_NDID, etc with a template class, say, GTMacro<IntType,NumWords>
    that has a constructor that takes vector of word sizes, or static set/get
    methods that accept a vector of word sizes.
40. Maybe for an intern: characterize GIO performance
41. Refactor grids. Big job.
42. Remove stateinfo structure from APIs; no longer needed, but must check this first
