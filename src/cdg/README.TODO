done: 1.   Apply FUZZYEQ to bdy location in ggrid_icos.cpp. 
2.   Handle Neumann bdy conditions: can same setup (use of ub) be used?
3.   Merge GComm with tbox
done: 4.   Build more generic driver/main program for all time-dep PDE sets
5.   Add constraint of field to sphere in embedded grid type case
6.   Make sure face indices, bdy types are being handled properly in GGridIcos for 3D elems
7.   Make sure that all element-local data that has been globalized is cleared
8.   Verify computation of amount of tmp space required by solver
9.   Complete flux operator, and validate faceNormal vector computations for DG
done:10.  Test I X I X D, I X D X I, etc operators; use only compute_refderivs, not
          compute_refderivsW in GAdvect to reduce no. flops required. NB: testing 
          done, but integration not done.
done: 11.  Add restart capability.
done: 12.  Add forcing.
done: 13.  Generalize the application of initial conditions.
14.  Remove iOpR2LIndices and associated quaitites from GGFX
15.  Should we handle boundary updates in the same way as forcing, not via a callback, but in call to constructor (e.g., like the 'mixer' object in Integrator)?
