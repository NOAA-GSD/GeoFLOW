## Introduction

To simplify the on-boarding of new developers during the Hackathon a 
seperate driver application and series of instructions have been carefully
developed. The hackathon driver application only excersises the portion of 
code we plan to concentrate on during the hackathon.  This portion of code
is a small (but important) fraction of the overall GeoFLOW code base.
This streamlined code (and the respective inputs) are only contained 
within the **feature/hackathon** branch of the GitHub repository so make 
sure you are inside the correct branch to avoid confusion.
